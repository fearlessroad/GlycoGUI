# GlycoGUI: a GUI for creating JSON files for input into polyply 
See polyply https://github.com/marrink-lab/polyply_1.0 developed by the Martini folks

>[!WARNING]
>This tool is under development. We are still adding monomers and linkage types! Currently, only a few monomers are supported, but the names and edge types can easily be edited in the JSON file to reflect those that you need


## Capabilities
- Add monomers to a carbohydrate chain
- Add and edit the linkages and linkage types
- Exports JSON with nodes and linkages
